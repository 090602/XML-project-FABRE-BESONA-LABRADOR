Introduction to XML
-------------------

During our time in **IT6/L**, together with my groupmates, we learned that XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a widely used language for structuring and storing data in a readable format.  
Unlike HTML, which focuses on displaying content, XML is designed for **data storage and transportation**. It allows users to define their own tags, making it highly flexible and applicable across different industries.
