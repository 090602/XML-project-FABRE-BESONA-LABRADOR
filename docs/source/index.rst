Introduction to XML,

During our time on IT6/L together with my Groupmates we learned that XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a widely used language for structuring and storing data in a readable format. Unlike HTML, which focuses on displaying content, XML is designed for data storage and transportation. It allows users to define their own tags, making it highly flexible and applicable across different industries.
